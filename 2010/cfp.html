	    		<p>
			Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are software-based systems that control and interact with 
			physical processes. Such systems play a key role in an ever increasing number of industries.
			For example, over 80% of the innovations in automotive systems are for cyber-enabled 
			system capabilities. Modern aircraft are carefully co-designed and tightly integrated CPS 
			machines. This trend is also demonstrated by modern medical systems. The movement 
			towards increasing dependency on software is driven by the fact that software enables the 
			delivery of a large number of customized  capabilities in a product using a relatively small 
			number of physical and computing platforms.
			</p>

			<p>
			However, the co-design of physical platforms, computer systems, and embedded software 
			systems and their tight integration also creates a high degree of complexity of interactions 
			within and across these systems that far exceeds the capability of existing system composition 
			technologies.  These technologies are of paramount importance to industries that integrate 
			independently-developed parts into their final products (e.g. automotive and avionics). 
			Furthermore, even though analytical models of such systems are currently used to predict 
			different system-level properties they are often developed on a property-by-property basis 
			by different teams leading to inconsistent assumptions and conclusions. The lack of effective 
			system-wide analytical results prevents the discovery of design flaws that stem from the 
			interaction complexity of the system parts; i.e. prevented until the system is physically 
			integrated. Due to such flaws, the system integration time often exceeds 50% of the total 
			development time for non-safety critical applications. In safety critical systems, such as 
			avionics, the system integration and certification time often exceeds 70% of total development 
			time and costs.
			</p>

			<p>
			Looking ahead, the success of next generation CPS systems demands system-wide architecture 
			design patterns and supporting technologies that can integrate legacy components, COTS 
			components and co-designed new components in such a way that properties such as real 
			time, safety, fault tolerance and security can be analyzed and predicted before the systems 
			are physically built. Moreover, it is necessary to have a system-wide composition model that 
			integrates the different analyses into a single consistent semantic framework to avoid 
			conflicting results. 
			</p>

			<p>
			This workshop focuses on analytical system composition technologies that will 
			eventually include:
			<ol>
				<li> Composition technologies to automatically propagate the impact of modifications in 
				one modeling domain into others.</li>
				<li> Assumption resolution between modeling abstractions and constructs of different 
				analysis domains. </li>
				<li> System-level schedulability optimization technologies that integrate constraints 
				imposed by other analytic domains (E.g: security, mechanical stress, heat dissipation, etc.)</li>
				<li> A quantitative and early analysis of the system architecture performance in an 
				end-to-end fashion, deriving perhaps even the worst/best/average case behaviour for the 
				entire platform and new hardware abstractions. In fact, existing task/system models reason 
				at levels that are well abstracted away from real details (and variations inherent in) 
				hardware components (e.g. multicores, memory architectures, I/O, network-on-chip, 
				etc.). They also are unable to cope with workloads that are beyond the capabilities of 
				traditional computational resources (e.g. video streams, weather data, GPS, etc.)</li>
				<li> Fault tolerance technologies and reliability analysis techniques that integrate the 
				different natures of physical, hardware and software faults in a common, consistent framework.</li>
				<li> Safety analysis such as model checking for mixed criticality CPS applications, for 
				example, flight management systems and/or safe medical devices plug and play (MDPnP)</li>
				<li> Security protocol development and verification techniques for CPS applications.</li>
				<li> Models for describing/quantifying the environments where such systems must operate.</li>
			</p>

			<p>
			The goal of this workshop is to explore architecture design patterns, tools and the theoretical 
			analytical foundations for creating common system-wide composition models where key 
			properties can be studied and guarantees provided before the start of actual development. 
			Of particular interest are the case studies on the challenges of expressing the properties of 
			the final product in terms of component properties and the architecture that governs their 
			interactions. Both solutions and/or open problems are welcome.
