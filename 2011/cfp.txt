Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are software-based systems that control and interact with 
physical processes. Such systems play a key role in an ever increasing number of industries.
For example, over 80% of the innovations in automotive systems are for cyber-enabled 
system capabilities. Modern aircraft are carefully co-designed and tightly integrated CPS 
machines. This trend is also demonstrated by modern medical systems. The movement 
towards increasing dependency on software is driven by the fact that software enables the 
delivery of a large number of customized  capabilities in a product using a relatively small 
number of physical and computing platforms.

However, the co-design of physical platforms, computer systems, and embedded software 
systems and their tight integration also creates a high degree of complexity of interactions 
within and across these systems that far exceeds the capability of existing system composition 
technologies.  These technologies are of paramount importance to industries that integrate 
independently-developed parts into their final products (e.g. automotive and avionics). 
Furthermore, even though analytical models of such systems are currently used to predict 
different system-level properties they are often developed on a property-by-property basis 
by different teams leading to inconsistent assumptions and conclusions. The lack of effective 
system-wide analytical results prevents the discovery of design flaws that stem from the 
interaction complexity of the system parts; i.e. prevented until the system is physically 
integrated. Due to such flaws, the system integration time often exceeds 50% of the total 
development time for non-safety critical applications. In safety critical systems, such as 
avionics, the system integration and certification time often exceeds 70% of total development 
time and costs.

Looking ahead, the success of next generation CPS systems demands system-wide architecture 
design patterns and supporting technologies that can integrate legacy components, COTS 
components and co-designed new components in such a way that properties such as real 
time, safety, fault tolerance and security can be analyzed and predicted before the systems 
are physically built. Moreover, it is necessary to have a system-wide composition model that 
integrates the different analyses into a single consistent semantic framework to avoid 
conflicting results. 

This workshop focuses on analytical system composition technologies that will 
eventually include:
(1) Composition technologies to automatically propagate the impact of modifications in 
one modeling domain into others.
(2) Assumption resolution between modeling abstractions and constructs of different 
analysis domains. 
(3) System-level schedulability optimization technologies that integrate constraints 
imposed by other analytic domains (E.g: security, mechanical stress, heat dissipation, etc.)
(4) A quantitative and early analysis of the system architecture performance in an 
end-to-end fashion, deriving perhaps even the worst/best/average case behaviour for the 
entire platform and new hardware abstractions. In fact, existing task/system models reason 
at levels that are well abstracted away from real details (and variations inherent in) 
hardware components (e.g. multicores, memory architectures, I/O, network-on-chip, 
etc.). They also are unable to cope with workloads that are beyond the capabilities of 
traditional computational resources (e.g. video streams, weather data, GPS, etc.)
(5) Fault tolerance technologies and reliability analysis techniques that integrate the 
different natures of physical, hardware and software faults in a common, consistent framework.
(6) Safety analysis such as model checking for mixed criticality CPS applications, for 
example, flight management systems and/or safe medical devices plug and play (MDPnP)
(7) Security protocol development and verification techniques for CPS applications.
(8) Models for describing/quantifying the environments where such systems must operate.

The goal of this workshop is to explore architecture design patterns, tools and the theoretical 
analytical foundations for creating common system-wide composition models where key 
properties can be studied and guarantees provided before the start of actual development. 
Of particular interest are the case studies on the challenges of expressing the properties of 
the final product in terms of component properties and the architecture that governs their 
interactions. Both solutions and/or open problems are welcome.

PAPER SUBMISSION

We encourage the submission of papers that present novel ideas, state-of-the-art, work-in-progress and 
suggest open issues. We also encourage the submission of position papers.

Submissions should be no more than 8 pages in two-column, single spaced, 10 pt format. 
Suggested latex style file from IEEE: 
ftp://pubftp.computer.org/Press/Outgoing/proceedings/IEEE_CS_Latex8.5x11x2.zip

All figures, references, etc. must fit within the 8 page limit. Papers that do not meet these requirements 
will not be reviewed. All submissions should be in the PDF format and submitted at the following link:
http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=avicps2010

Submission of the paper implies that should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will 
register and present the paper at the workshop. 

Please contact Dioniso de Niz (dionisio@sei.cmu.edu) or Sibin Mohan (sibin@cs.uiuc.edu) for 
further information or if you wish to submit a paper but may have difficulties meeting the deadline.
