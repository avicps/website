The <b>Analytic Virtual Integration Cyber-Physical Systems (AVICPS)
workshop</b> focuses on analytic techniques that enable the early
discovery of faults in CPS before the system is integrated or its
parts are built. Such an approach is known as analytic virtual
integration. The objective is to discover and resolve problems early
during the design and implementation phases where cost impact is low.
</p>


<p>
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
<ol>
<li> A quantitative and early analysis of end-to-end system 
     architecture performance that incorporates realistic hardware 
     details (e.g. multi-core, memory architectures, I/O, 
     network-on-chip, etc.) and workloads (e.g. video streams, 
     weather data, GPS, critical messages, etc.)
<li> Fault tolerance technologies for handling the combination 
     of faults in computing and communication hardware and software 
	 and physical system disturbances.
<li> Safety analysis such as model checking for mixed criticality 
     CPS applications (e.g., flight management systems and safe 
     interoperability of medical devices).
<li> System level optimization technologies that support the 
     combinatorial optimization of task scheduling and allocation, 
     I/O, and network traffic routing.
<li> Security protocol development and verification techniques for 
     CPS applications.
<li> Modeling, simulation, and verification techniques for virtual 
     integration.
<li> Models for describing or quantifying the environment that 
     systems must operate in.
<li> Quantitative measurements of the advantages of virtual 
     integration.
<li> Formal methods for defining and reasoning about internal and
     external interfaces of the system and its parts.
<li> Cross-domain compositional theories and technologies for CPS.
</ol>



	  <a name="submission"></a>
<h3>Submission</h3>

The AVICPS workshop welcomes original contributions on
theoretical foundation, tools, and evaluations.  Of particular 
interest are case studies on challenges of expressing properties 
of systems in terms of their components and the architecture 
that governs their interactions. Both solutions and open problems 
are welcome.
<p> 
Researchers and practitioners are encouraged to submit two types 
of papers:
	    
<ul>
<li><i>Research papers</i> that present novel ideas, mature
tools, results, and advancement of the state-of-the-art.
<li><i>Position papers</i> that describe ongoing work, less
mature work, or new research directions. 
</ul>
</p>

<p>Submissions should be no more than 8 pages (for research
papers) and 4 pages (for position papers) in two-column format. 
Templates and author guidelines are available for 
<a href="avicps-latex-template.zip">LaTeX</a> and 
<a href="avicps-word-template.zip">Microsoft Word</a>. 
All figures and references must fit within the 
specified page limits. </p>

<p>Papers should be submitted as PDF-files in A4 format using 
the <a href="https://www.softconf.com/e/avicps/">following 
link</a>.
	  

<h3>Publication</h3>

Authors of accepted papers may choose one of the following 
alternatives.

<ul>
<li>To include their paper in formal electronic proceedings 
published by <a href="http://www.ep.liu.se/">LiU Electronic 
Press</a>. The proceedings are given both ISBN and ISSN numbers. 
Authors retain the copyright of their work.
<li>To not include it in the proceedings, thus make it possible 
to refine and submit the work elsewhere. Only a title and a 
short abstract of the paper will be available in the proceedings. An informal copy of the accepted paper will be available on the AVICPS website.
</ul>
Regardless of the author's choice of dissemination, the reviewing 
process and the presentation time at the workshop will be the same. 
For all accepted papers, at least one of the authors must register 
and present the paper at the workshop. </p>

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to send an email to the <a href="tpc.html"> co-chairs</a>.
